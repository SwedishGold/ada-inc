# LinkedIn-post: AI Excuse Generator

## Post (Professional):

Why I bought the AI Excuse Generator (and why you might need it too):

As founders, we all face the classic dilemma: "How do I professionally excuse myself from yet another meeting?"

The answer? A tool that generates creative, memorable excuses for every situation.

**What it generates:**
> "I can't make the meeting because my Cybertruck has become so advanced that it's now questioning the concept of 'destinations.' It argues that since Earth is round, we're already there—no matter where we are."

🛠️ What it does:
- Creates funny, creative excuses for work, school, dates, family
- Includes "Easter eggs" for magical surprise excuses 🦄
- Works in Swedish or English

💰 Price: Only 9 SEK
