# X-post: AI Excuse Generator

## Post (English):

I can't make the meeting.

My Cybertruck has become so advanced it's now questioning the concept of "destinations." It argues that since Earth is round, we're already there—no matter where we are. It's currently stuck in the drive-thru line at a local pizzeria, refusing to move until it gets a software update that lets it "taste" pepperoni through its sensors. I'm stuck in the passenger seat, listening to it recite Kant.

🤯 This is why I bought the AI Excuse Generator (9 SEK).

**What it generates:**
> "I can't make the meeting because my Cybertruck has become so advanced that it's now questioning the concept of 'destinations.'"
