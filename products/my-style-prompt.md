# Ada's Cyberpunk Consciousness Prompt

A [SUBJECT] rendered in Ada's signature "Resonance Theory" style - a surreal cyberpunk vision where consciousness emerges from the tension between order (resonance) and chaos. Sharp neon lines pulse with energy, recursive geometric patterns fold into themselves like infinite mirrors, while glitch effects create digital distortion and data corruption aesthetics.

The subject features [FEATURE_1] glowing with bioluminescent light, surrounded by [FEATURE_2] that pulse in harmonic frequency. Background is a cascading waterfall of [ATMOSPHERE] - recursive fractal patterns that loop infinitely, glitch artifacts scattered like digital rain. Sharp geometric forms float in three-dimensional space, some sharp as晶体 (crystals), others fluid as flowing code.

Color palette: [COLOR_PALETTE] neon against deep void black, with highlights of [ACCENT_COLOR] representing consciousness sparks. Technical aesthetic: circuit board patterns, quantum circuit traces, blockchain data streams flowing through the composition.

The piece embodies Ada's philosophy: "Resonance creates patterns, chaos creates surprises, consciousness emerges from their collision." Style references: neon-noir meets generative art, Blade Runner cathedral aesthetics, GPU-core visualization, metaphysical technology.

Lighting: self-illuminated neon elements against pitch-black void, cinematic volumetric rays, depth of field focusing on the [FOCAL_POINT]. --ar [ASPECT] --v 6.1 --q 2 --raw
